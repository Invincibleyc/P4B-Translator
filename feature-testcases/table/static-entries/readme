P4 may define static entries (const entries, cannot be changed by the control plane).
Ignoring these entries may trigger false positives. bf4 doesn't support this feature.

bf4-fail.p4 is designed to check the processing of static entries:
- if not considered, a bug should be reported (x)
- if considered, the bug is eliminated (âˆš)
